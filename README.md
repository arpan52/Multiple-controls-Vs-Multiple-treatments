# Multiple-controls-Vs-Multiple-treatments

# Description
This repository contains all the original **R** codes used for the numerical studies in the paper entitled **On power optimal designs for comparing a set of controls to a set of treatments** authored by **_Arpan Singh, Satya Prakash Singh_**.

# Instructions
 To reproduce the results, use the original **R** codes that are available in the **Main** branch. 

1) The following **R** packages are required to use the codes,\
      a) **nloptr**\
      b) **mvtnorm**\
      c) **tictoc**
      
3) Names of the main files and the **R** codes are self-explainatory. For example the file **Empirical power (Table 4)** contains all the **R** codes used to produce all the **Empirical powers** of all the designs given in the **Table 4**. 

4) Similarly, the **R** code **empirical_power_IUT_K6_1424343536.r**  produce the **empirical power** for **IUT** test associated to a bipartite graph with **K=6** comparison groups. Further, the set of pairs to be compared are **{(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)}**.
